# Word-Data
This repository shows some of my work with words and the different ways I analyzed them.

# Rapid Minor
I have a quick introduction analysis to Rapid Minor and how it is beneficial with text mining.

# Linux
The Linux file is using PDFs in a command environment and showing how to pull in pictures and use them in the analytics of text. This displays how to manipulate images and PDFs using Linux on any platform. I decided to explore the environment using CentOS7.

# Python Text Analysis
Here I wanted to complete a text analysis comparing 2 separate texts in Python. This will help display how python can use its algorithms to compare different texts by looking at how many times certain words appear within an analysis.
